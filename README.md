This project contains some simple Node.js code that does the following;
1. Passes a hard coded message to the Facebook Graph API resulting in the message being displayed in a FaceBook feed

Limitations: 
1. In the first release of this project we are relying on the access token being copied from developers.facebook.com - Graph API Explorer ..
This access token then needs to be copied and pasted into config.js file before running node server.js

Usage:
node posttopage.js
